   - question: What is Devknox and how does it work?
     answer: Devknox is a security plugin for the Android Studio IDE that detects and corrects security issues as you write code, real-time. Simply install the plugin and let Devknox detect, suggest and remediate all your security threats while you code and build your app.
   - question : Is Devknox available for both the Android and iOS development platforms?
     answer : Devknox is currently available only for the Android Studio IDE. We are currently working on a similar plugin for Xamarin to facilitate usage by iOS developers.
   - question : What is the data privacy policy at Devknox? Is my data safe if I use this plugin?
     answer : All the security analysis is performed locally on your machine and nothing get's sent to our servers except for verification of your login information. We do not store any of your data and you can be rest assured that it is completely safe within your security parameters.
   - question : How is Devknox different from using other static code analyzers?
     answer : Most static code analyzers do pretty much the same thing and that is to ensure basic security of an app by analyzing code. However, unlike Devknox, most static code analyzers usually scan the ‘entire app’ during development or after production. Devknox gives you the power to detect threats instantly while coding and enables you to take care of security as you build your app. We all know how time-consuming and difficult it is to go back and fix issues after production.
   - question: What is the optimum system requirements needed to use Devknox? Will it cause performance issues in my IDE?
     answer: It is suggested to have the recommended system specifications as mentioned by Android Studio/Intellij IDE for smooth running of the IDE along with the Devknox plugin. As long as you have the recommended system requirements Devknox plugin will run fine similar to any other plugin or add-on that you might be using.
